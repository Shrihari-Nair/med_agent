The `MultiDatabaseManager` provides unified access to all databases with intelligent querying:

```python
from src.database.multi_db_manager import MultiDatabaseManager

manager = MultiDatabaseManager()
manager.connect_all()

# Comprehensive medicine analysis
insight = manager.get_comprehensive_medicine_info(
    "Aspirin", 
    patient_age_months=300,  # 25 years
    other_medicines=["Warfarin"]
)

# Safety analysis for complete prescription
safety = manager.analyze_prescription_safety(
    ["Aspirin", "Warfarin"], 
    patient_age_months=300
)

# Find alternatives for condition
alternatives = manager.find_alternatives_for_condition(
    "Hypertension",
    exclude_medicines=["Atenolol"],
    patient_age_months=600  # 50 years
)
```
